This repository is a personal study guide where I'm implementing and analyzing algorithms from the book **"Algoritmos a profundidad: De cero a senior"**, using **Java** as the main language.  
The goal is to consolidate knowledge of fundamental and advanced algorithms through practical examples and progressive challenges.
